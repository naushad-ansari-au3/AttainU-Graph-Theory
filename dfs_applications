1) Detecting cycle in a graph which is extremely essential in Operating Systems for something 
called deadlock detection in resource allocation.

2) The DFS algorithm can be used to find a path between two given vertices u and z.
i) Call DFS(G, u) with u as the start vertex.
ii) Use a stack S to keep track of the path between the start vertex and the current vertex.
iii) As soon as destination vertex z is encountered, return the path as the
contents of the stack

3) Solving mazes and other puzzles with only one solution.
